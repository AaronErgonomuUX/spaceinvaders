TEST
----

* Handle loss by invaders reaching bottom (not ship collision!)
* Make rocket speeds configurable.
* Limit to rocket rate.
* refactor settings and state.
* separate the starfield so that it can fill the screen
  and draw on its own canvas at a much lower framerate (stars
  will move more slowly).
* Make the main page instantiate/start the game
* Support move and fire at the same time.
* support full size
